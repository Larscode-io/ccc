      <p class="textnormal">The XIVth Congress of the Conference of European   Constitutional Courts will be held on 2-7 June, 2008, in Vilnius. This decision   was made during the preparatory meeting of the Presidents of courts, which are   the members of the Conference of European Constitutional Courts on 7-8 September   2006, in Vilnius.<BR>
      </p>
      <p class="textnormal">The Preparatory meeting accepted applications from the new members to join the   Conference. The Supreme Court of Denmark, the Constitutional Court of Montenegro   and the Constitutional Court of Serbia became full members of the Conference of   European Constitutional Courts.</p>
      <p class="textnormal">Members of the preparatory meeting in Vilnius also discussed and approved the   subject of the XIVth Congress and the emblem of the Conference. The topic of the   XIVth Congress is "Legislative Omission of the Constitutional Jurisprudence".</p>
      <p class="textnormal">The Lithuanian Constitutional Court has held chairmanship of   the Conference of European Constitutional Courts since May 2005. Such decision   was adopted<SPAN lang="lt"> </SPAN>at the XIIIth Congress of the Conference of   European Constitutional Courts which was held in Nicosia (Cyprus) on 16-18 May   2005. In rotation of three years, chairmanship of the Conference of European   Constitutional Courts is held by one of the courts which is a full member of the   Conference.</p>
      <p class="textnormal">The Conference of European Constitutional Courts, which was established<SPAN lang="lt"> </SPAN>in Dubrovnik in 1972, unites representatives from 39 European   constitutional or equivalent courts. The Conference is an organisation which   arranges congresses at regular intervals. It promotes exchange of information   among its members as regards issues of methods and practice of constitutional   review and sharing opinions about institutional, structural and work problems in   the areas of public law and constitutional jurisdiction. Besides, it takes   measures, which strengthen the independence of constitutional courts as an   essential element of the guarantee and implementation of democracy and a state   under the rule of law and pays attention to protection of human rights in   particular. It gives much support to improve constant relations between European   constitutional courts and similar institutions.</p>
      <p class="textnormal">While holding chairmanship of the Conference, the Lithuanian Constitutional   Court represents it in various international forums.</p>
      <p class="textnormal">The Lithuanian Constitutional Court became a full member of the Conference of   European Constitutional Courts in 1997.</p>
