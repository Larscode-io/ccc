      <p class="textnormal">Welcome to the website of the Conference of European 
        Constitutional Courts. The website was created by the Court of Arbitration 
        of Belgium, organizer of the XIIth Congress of this association.</p>
      <p class="textnormal">The Conference of European Constitutional Courts was 
        set up in 1972 by the constitutional courts of Germany, Austria, Italy 
        and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Many other constitutional courts 
        joined the Conference, particularly in the last decade. The association 
        currently numbers 34 European constitutional courts and other similar 
        European institutions exercising constitutional jurisdiction. The Conference 
        owes its existence to the intention of the Presidents of constitutional 
        courts to organize regular specialized conferences with a view to sharing 
        experience as regards constitutional practice and jurisprudence in a general 
        European context and to maintaining regular contacts between these courts 
        and institutions, on the basis of mutual respect and with due regard to 
        the principle of judicial independence.</p>
      <p class="textnormal">The website is aimed chiefly and primarily at offering 
        electronic access to the different national reports, the general report 
        and the reports of the European Court of Human Rights and the Court of 
        Justice of the European Communities that were prepared for the Congress. 
        The Congress, which convenes every three years, is the body in which representatives 
        of the full members (thirty-three constitutional courts) and of the associate 
        members (one constitutional court) hold an academic debate on a theme 
        connected with constitutional jurisdiction. In addition, observers and 
        guests are invited to take part in the discussions. The theme of the Congress 
        that will take place in Brussels from 14 to 16 May 2002 is &quot;The relations 
        between the Constitutional Courts and the other national courts, including 
        the interference in this area of the action of the European courts&quot;.</p>
      <p class="textnormal">Furthermore, the visitor to this website will find 
        interesting information about the association itself. He can consult the 
        Statute of the Conference in the official languages of the association 
        (French, English, German and Russian) and in Dutch. Via the list of members 
        of the Conference - not states but constitutional courts or other similar 
        jurisdictional bodies of European states -, he can also access the websites 
        of several constitutional courts by using the updated links that have 
        been added.</p>
      <p class="textnormal">This website is still under construction. Several 
        documents can only be put on the website during or after the Congress 
        in Brussels. This is particularly the case for the history of the Conference, 
        for which we will use the speeches delivered at the official opening meeting 
        on 14 May 2002, and for the list of administrative decisions and academic 
        conclusions that will ensue from the Congress.</p>
      <p><span class="textnormal">We hope that the website will contribute to 
        a growing social and academic interest in constitutional jurisdiction, 
        which unquestionably can be regarded as one of the most notable democratic 
        and constitutional guarantees of the second half of the last century.</span><br>
