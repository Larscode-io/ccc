      <p class="textnormal">The Constitutional Court of Romania is very much  honoured to host the XVth Congress of the Conference of European Constitutional  Courts, a highly significant event in their activity, for ensuring the supremacy  of constitutional principles.<br>
        <br>
In this context, I am pleased to extend a warm  &quot;Welcome&quot; to Bucharest to all distinguished participants, full  members from 40 countries, associate members, observers and guests, organised  in an institutional framework of a pan-European dimension. <br>
<br>
The magnitude of this evolution is based on a generous  idea launched 39 years ago, through the Dubrovnik Project of the Presidents of  Constitutional Courts from Germany, Austria, Italy and the former Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia, a project for whose accomplishment so many personalities  from the area of constitutional law and also political life have substantially  contributed.<br>
<br>
The historical developments at the end of the last  century, which led to the establishment of democracy and the rule of law in  Central and Eastern Europe, gave an unprecedented boost to broadening and  strengthening the institutional framework of cooperation between constitutional  courts, to their joint efforts to promote the key objectives pursued by the  founding members: the exchange of information on working methods and  constitutional case-law in the general European context, as well as the  enhancement of contacts between European constitutional courts and similar  institutions on institutional, structural and material issues in the realm of constitutional  justice.<br>
<br>
In that regard, we particularly appreciate that our  discussions in Bucharest are focused on a topic of utmost importance nowadays: <strong>&quot;Constitutional justice: functions and  relations with the other public authorities.&quot;</strong> We believe that our dialogue  will generate consistent and innovative ideas, such as are meant to enshrine  the constitutional courts&rsquo; independence in relation to the other public  authorities and to increase their role in strengthening the rule of law in  contemporary society, which is called upon to face increasingly complex and  difficult challenges.<br>
<br>
As with other branches of national or European law,  constitutional law must reflect as closely as possible the new social  realities, so that further reforms prove to be necessary in many of the Member  States of the Conference. And all these, for the sole purpose of increasing confidence,  of both citizens and other public authorities, in constitutional justice &ndash; as a  guarantor for the democracy.<br>
<br>
The Congress will give the participants the  opportunity to share their experience, their doubts or certainties, and - why  not so? &ndash; will provide alternatives, answers or solutions to the problems  arising in connection with the debated subjects.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The dynamics of the activity the Constitutional Court  of Romania has been carrying on, ever since its creation, show a growing number  of cases submitted by the principal institutions of the State. That is why the debate  of the topic on the agenda of the Bucharest Congress is to us as much necessary  and appropriate. It harmoniously concords with the series of previous debates and  opens up the perspective of new approaches to constitutional principles, in  step with the times we live.<br>
<br>
In this way, we are privileged to contribute together  to the common heritage of European law, having the duty to add new values,  always serving the cititizen&rsquo;s interests and the development of democracy.<br>
<br>
Bucharest will thus be able to mark a significant  stage in the prodigious activity of the Conference. May the same vision guide  us in the preparations for the forthcoming Conference to be held in Austria.</p>
