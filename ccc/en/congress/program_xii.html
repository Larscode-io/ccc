              in the Province of Hainaut </span><br>
              Bus tour of the old part of Tournai. The centre of Tournai bears 
              witness to the town's glorious past. Listed by UNESCO as part of 
              the world heritage, the Belfry and Notre Dame Cathedral dominate 
              the city. On the renovated Grand Place, the Cloth Hall illustrates 
              the full splendour of the Renaissance. The trip also takes in the 
              churches of Saint-Quentin and Saint-Jacques, the Romanesque and 
              Gothic houses, and the extraordinary Pont des Trous.<br>
              Visit to the Museum of Decorative Arts. Tournai acquired its artistic 
              fame in the 18th century with its magnificent collection of porcelain. 
              This will be an opportunity to admire the local products and to 
              place them in the context of European porcelain.<br>
              Lunch was served in the old seminary of Choiseul.<br>
              The afternoon was devoted to a visit to the Ch&acirc;teau of Seneffe. 
              The ch&acirc;teau was built between 1763 and 1768 by the master 
              builder Beno&icirc;t Dewez, official architect of the Austrian Netherlands, 
              and was commissioned by Julien Depestre, Count of Seneffe and Turnhout. 
              The ch&acirc;teau is at the centre of a remarkable 18th-century 
              complex comprising outbuildings, an orangery, a small neoclassical 
              theatre, an icehouse and a French garden situated in 22 hectares 
              of grounds. The ch&acirc;teau, which has been converted into a Silver 
              Museum of the French Community, accommodates the European silver 
              collection of Claude and Juliette D'Allemagne.</p>
