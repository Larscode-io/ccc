      <p class="textnormal">Dear Friends!<br>
        <br>
I would like to give you the warmest of welcomes to the webpages of the Conference of European Constitutional Courts. I would like to emphasise the fact that it is an extraordinary honour and privilege for the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic to have been chosen to head this organisation in the years 2017–2020 and to be able to hold the XVIII Congress of the Conference of European Constitutional Courts.<br>
<br>
Many challenges, as well as many opportunities, await us over the coming three years. In 2018, I will have the pleasure of welcoming my colleagues – Presidents of European Constitutional Courts – to Prague for the Circle of Presidents to agree on the points of departure for the Congress to be held two years later. I do not, however, want to concentrate merely on these events. I will be grateful for every opportunity that enables representatives of the European constitutional judiciary to continue its dialogue on the key issues of our time.<br>
<br>
I would like to see the Czech Constitutional Court acting as a bridge between the courts of Europe. I would like to see us continuing to develop our co-operation and to intensify the pan-European exchange of knowledge, ideas and experience. Only in this way can we achieve an even higher level of protection for the constitutionality and human rights on our continent.<br>
<br>
        I and the entire Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic want to engage personally in turning these ideas into reality. I will be delighted if the webpage you have just visited helps in this endeavour.<br>
        <br>
