            <p>The Conference organises congresses at regular intervals. It promotes the exchange of information among its members on issues relating to the methods and practice of constitutional review and provides a forum for the participants to share opinions on institutional, structural and practical problems in the areas of public law and constitutional jurisdiction. Besides, it takes measures to strengthen the independence of constitutional courts as an essential element of the guarantee and implementation of democracy and a state under the rule of law and pays particular attention to the protection of human rights. It strongly supports the improvement of lasting relations between European constitutional courts and similar institutions. <br>
              <br>
              The chairmanship of the Conference of European Constitutional Courts, rotating every three years, can only be held by a court that is a full member of the Conference.<br>
              <br>
            From 2011 to 2014, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Austria chairs the Conference of European Constitutional Courts.</p>
            <p>The Circle of Presidents (preparatory meeting) will take place in Vienna from September 9 to 11, 2012. The XVIth Congress will be organized in May 2014.</p>
