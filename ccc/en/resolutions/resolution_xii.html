              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&deg; has already suggested the

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) 
              the relationship between the constitutional courts and the European

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b)

              human dignity as source of basic rights<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) 
              access of individuals to the constitutional courts<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and has taken note of several interventions 
              in favour of a subject that is not too broad, that relates to the 
              common concerns of the constitutional courts, and that tends to 
              be more oriented towards substantive law.</p>
