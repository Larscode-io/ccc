            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The XIII Conference  shall take place at Nicosia between the 15th &ndash; 19th&nbsp; May, 2005.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The theme of the XIII  Conference shall be &ldquo;The Criteria of the Limitation of Human Rights in the  Practice of Constitutional Justice&rdquo;. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Supreme Court of  Cyprus shall draw up a questionnaire designed to elicit the response of members  in their national reports,&nbsp; to  the various aspects of the theme of the Conference with particular emphasis on  the following three aspects of the subject.&nbsp; </p>
            <br clear="all">
            <blockquote>
              <p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; Juridical amenity to limit the application of human rights, the  identification of the rights that may be subject to limitation or suspension,  the prerequisites that must be satisfied before imposing permissible  limitations and the duration of such limitations.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; The jurisprudence (case law), of European  Constitutional Courts on the subject of limitation of human rights.</p>
              <p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; Jurisprudence (case law) of supranational European Courts and its  impact on national constitutional jurisdictions.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  questionnaire shall be drawn up by the Supreme Court of Cyprus and it shall be  circulated by the 29th of February 2004.&nbsp; It shall be drawn up in the official  languages of the Conference.&nbsp; Members  shall draw up their national reports in their language as well as in French or  in English and submit them to the Supreme Court of Cyprus by the end of  November 2004.&nbsp; For the facilitation of  the submission of national reports the Venice Commission has undertaken to  submit a report on the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and  European Constitutional Courts (to the extent known) on the subject to be debated.</p>
            <br clear="all">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  reports of the members will be circulated in hard copy and made public on the  website of the Court of Arbitration of Belgium; for this purpose the members  shall send their report, written in the chosen languages, in electronic format  to the Supreme Court of Cyprus.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following  the submission of the questionnaire the organizing court shall seek from  members of the Conference nominations for:<br> 
            (a) A General Rapporteur.<br>
(b)  Chairpersons who will preside over debates of the subtopics of the theme of the  Conference.<br>
(c)  Rapporteurs to report on the deliberations on specific parts of the subject at  the Conference.&nbsp; Following the submission  of nominations or expression of interest on behalf of members to act as Rapporteurs  or Chairpersons at the Conference, the organizers will, subject to the approval  of members, decide upon the persons who shall act in the aforementioned  capacities.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Observers  and guests as well as representatives of the highest jurisdictional authority  of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, shall be invited  to attend the XIII Conference.&nbsp; Moreover  distinguished jurists in the field of constitutional law may be invited in  their personal capacity as guests by the host Court. </p></td>
